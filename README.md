# WikiRoulette

Wikiroulette scrapes Wikipedia pages via the Mechanize gem, collecting all links and displaying them to the user after each click via Jquery. Additionally, this was a short experiment in working with AJAX to make   asynchronous requests, allowing me to load new content to the page without redirecting or refreshing until the game is over.

The idea was inspired by an old game with Wikipedia, something like seven degrees of separation, that I used to play with friends. It's possible to link from any wiki page to another in seven clicks or less. (My proudest feat was to link from Benito Mussolini to Britney Spears in less than seven clicks!) In a similar vein, I wanted to build an app that enables users to just keep on clicking links until they're satisfied, and then see what path through Wikipedia they went on. 
      
The more you play, the more hilarious the results, as you can end up truly anywhere. Enjoy!
